Dr. Insop Song from GitHub provided a masterful overview of "Agentic AI and Software Development," tracing the evolution from simple auto-completion to sophisticated autonomous software engineering agents. His presentation effectively contextualized current AI coding assistants within the broader trajectory of language model capabilities.

Dr. Song's explanation of the progression from Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to tool usage to full agentic behavior provided crucial technical context for understanding why 2025 represents an inflection point. His demonstration of how agentic systems can now understand entire codebases, execute commands, run tests, and iterate based on feedback illustrated the emergence of truly autonomous software development workflows.

The practical implications were striking: AI systems that can not only generate code but also debug, refactor, and maintain software systems with minimal human oversight. Dr. Song's emphasis on the importance of testing and feedback loops in agentic development highlighted how these systems are beginning to embody software engineering best practices autonomously.

## Dr. Minha Hwang's Research Revolution

([Presentations Slides](/resource/seminars/07 - 21-may-2025/slides/Harnessing the Power of AI in Research and Data Science - Minha Hwang.pdf))

Dr. Minha Hwang from Microsoft delivered a compelling presentation on "Harnessing the Power of AI in Research and Data Science," which effectively demonstrated how AI is fundamentally reshaping the research process itself. His systematic breakdown of the research workflow—from problem formulation through publication—revealed how AI agents are becoming indispensable collaborators rather than mere tools.

Particularly illuminating was Dr. Hwang's distinction between traditional data scientists and "Gen AI Data Scientists." The new paradigm emphasizes high-level problem definition and orchestration of AI agents rather than low-level coding implementation. He demonstrated how platforms like Microsoft Copilot's "Analyst" agent enable researchers to focus on insight generation and strategic thinking while delegating routine data manipulation and visualization tasks to AI systems.

His live demonstrations of Deep Research capabilities across ChatGPT, Gemini, and other platforms showcased how AI can now conduct comprehensive literature reviews and synthesize findings in minutes rather than hours or days. This capability represents a fundamental acceleration of the research cycle, potentially transforming how scientific knowledge is discovered and validated.

# Emerging Themes and Technical Insights

## The MCP Revolution

A central theme throughout the evening was the emergence of Model Context Protocol (MCP) as a potential game-changer for agentic AI deployment. Dr. Lim's detailed explanation of MCP's architecture revealed how this standard could solve the "data hegemony" problem that currently limits agent effectiveness.

The asymmetric nature of MCP—where agents can request data without requiring data holders to expose their systems—offers a practical path toward rapid adoption. This contrasts with more complex peer-to-peer protocols like Google's Agent-to-Agent (A2A) framework, which require symmetric capabilities and complex orchestration.

## Multi-Agent System Architecture

The presentations collectively painted a picture of AI's evolution toward specialized, collaborative systems. Rather than pursuing ever-larger monolithic models, the field appears to be moving toward ecosystems of specialized agents that can be composed dynamically based on task requirements.

Dr. Song's examples of coding agents, testing agents, and guardrail agents working in coordination illustrated how this specialization can lead to more reliable and efficient outcomes than single-agent approaches. The ability to distribute complex tasks across multiple specialized agents also offers advantages in terms of debugging, monitoring, and incremental improvement.

## Privacy and Security Considerations

While not the primary focus, privacy considerations permeated the discussions. Dr. Lim's presentation on UClone's secure RAG implementation using homomorphic encryption highlighted how privacy-preserving techniques can enable agentic systems to work with sensitive data without compromising security.

The challenge of maintaining data privacy while enabling agent collaboration remains a critical consideration as these systems become more prevalent in enterprise environments.

# Interactive Dialogue and Cross-Pollination

The Q&A session revealed the depth of expertise in the audience and generated several memorable exchanges. A particularly engaging discussion emerged around the timeline for widespread adoption of multi-agent systems, with speakers offering varying perspectives on whether technical capabilities or organizational readiness would prove the limiting factor.

The conversation about standardization protocols sparked debate about whether the industry should rally around a single standard like MCP or whether multiple competing protocols might drive faster innovation. This tension between standardization and competition reflects broader challenges in the rapidly evolving AI landscape.

# Key Takeaways and Future Implications

Several major themes emerged from the evening's discussions:
