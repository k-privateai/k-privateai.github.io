Dear folks, [Recipient's Name],

We are pleased to invite you to our upcoming K-Group seminar series on Private AI, aimed at fostering knowledge sharing, networking, and discussions on business and entrepreneurship about personalized privacy preserving AI within our community.

The goals of the seminar series is to learn the state-of-the-art technologies by inviting experts to discuss AI and Data, which are key topics for AI-driven future society and economy as well as privacy protection and authentication. We will also discuss the applications and industries that will emerge as these technologies advance and combine.

	Brief intro to homomorphic encryption (HE)
</h2>

Homomorphic encryption (HE) is a form of encryption that allows computations to be performed on encrypted data without decrypting it first. This ensures that sensitive information remains confidential even while it is being processed, enabling secure operations like addition or multiplication on ciphertexts. The results of these operations, when decrypted, are identical to the results of performing the same computations on the unencrypted data.
HE is particularly useful in privacy-sensitive fields like healthcare and finance, as it allows for secure data processing in cloud computing environments without exposing the underlying data to third parties.
