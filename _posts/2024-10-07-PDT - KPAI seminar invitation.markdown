Dear Innovators, Visionaries, and Tech Enthusiasts of Silicon Valley,

We are excited to invite you to our upcoming K-Group seminar series on Private AI (K-PAI).
This series aims to foster knowledge sharing, networking, and discussions
on business and entrepreneurship related to personalized privacy-preserving AI within our community.
(Please visit <a href="https://k-privateai.github.io/">here</a> to find out more about K-PAI!)

The seminar series will feature experts discussing state-of-the-art technologies in AI and Data,
which are crucial for an AI-driven future society and economy, as well as privacy protection and authentication.
We will explore the applications and industries that will emerge as these technologies advance.

<h2 id="he">Brief intro to Homomorphic Encryption (HE)</h2>

Homomorphic encryption (HE) is a form of encryption that allows computations to be performed on encrypted data without decrypting it first. This ensures that sensitive information remains confidential even while it is being processed, enabling secure operations like addition or multiplication on ciphertexts. The results of these operations, when decrypted, are identical to the results of performing the same computations on the unencrypted data.
HE is particularly useful in privacy-sensitive fields like healthcare and finance, as it allows for secure data processing in cloud computing environments without exposing the underlying data to third parties.

<h2 id="target-audience">Target Audience</h2>

<p>
This series is designed for individuals interested in acquiring and integrating cutting-edge technologies, those planning innovative businesses in advanced sectors, and anyone looking to enhance their current business with AI or privacy-enhancing cryptography (PEC).
</p>

<p>
We look forward to your participation in what promises to be an enriching series of discussions. If you have any questions or topics you’d like to propose, feel free to reach out!
