Greetings, Silicon Valley Innovators, Visionaries &amp; Tech Enthusiasts!

Thanks to your enthusiastic participation and support, the first two Silicon Valley Private AI Forum (K-PAI) seminars were a resounding success!
The second seminar, in particular, brought together a number of remarkable professionals—entrepreneurs, investors,
engineers, scientists, market analysts, HR leaders, and even journalists—sparking vibrant discussions and active networking.
The energy was so palpable that it was hard to wrap up the event amidst the lively exchanges!
(Check out [our reflections on the 2nd K-PAI Seminar](/blog/PDT-K-PAI-2nd-seminar/)).

Following the success of our first two K-PAI seminars, we're thrilled to invite you to yet another event of ours!

<!--Because to truly see the holistic view of the rising technology called Artificial Intelligence (AI),
we have to see not only the technology, but other areas such as industry, market, hardware, society, ethics, entrepreneurs, and even investors.
For that, this seminar will explore the rapid evolution of AI, focusing
on the last decade's breakthroughs like deep learning (DL) and large language models (LLMs),
and their impact on industries and markets.
It delves into both the promises and perils of AI, offering strategies
for navigating an AI-driven future while maximizing benefits and mitigating risks.
Finally, it examines deeper questions about AI's capabilities, consciousness, and the very nature of its knowledge.-->

Understanding Artificial Intelligence (AI) requires more than just examining the technology itself—it
demands a comprehensive view encompassing its industrial applications, market dynamics, hardware infrastructure, societal implications,
ethical considerations, entrepreneurial opportunities, and investment landscape.
This seminar traces AI's rapid evolution, with particular emphasis on the transformative breakthroughs of the past decade,
including deep learning (DL), large language models (LLMs), generative AI (genAI), and AI agents.
We'll explore how these advances are reshaping industries and markets
while carefully examining both AI's tremendous potential and its inherent challenges.
<!--Through this exploration, we'll develop strategies for thriving in an AI-driven future, balancing innovation with responsible development.-->
The seminar concludes by addressing fundamental questions about AI's capabilities,
the nature of machine intelligence, and its relationship to human consciousness.
