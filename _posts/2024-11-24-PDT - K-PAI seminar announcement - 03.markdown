Seminar: The AI Knight Rises - From Deep Learning to Flourishing Societies
</h2>
인공지능의 비상: 딥러닝을 넘어서!

- Speaker: <a href="https://sungheeyun.github.io/">Sunghee Yun</a> - Co-founder &amp; CTO @ <a href="https://sungheeyun-erudio.github.io/">Erudio Bio, Inc.</a>
- Time: 6PM - 6:50PM (50 min)
- The abstract and slides can be found <a href="https://sungheeyun.github.io/#ai-knight-rises">here</a>.

Understanding Artificial Intelligence (AI) requires more than just examining the technology itself—it
demands a comprehensive view encompassing its industrial applications, market dynamics, hardware infrastructure, societal implications,
ethical considerations, entrepreneurial opportunities, and investment landscape.
This seminar traces AI's rapid evolution, with particular emphasis on the transformative breakthroughs of the past decade,
including deep learning (DL), large language models (LLMs), generative AI (genAI), and AI agents.
We'll explore how these advances are reshaping industries and markets
while carefully examining both AI's tremendous potential and its inherent challenges.
<!--Through this exploration, we'll develop strategies for thriving in an AI-driven future, balancing innovation with responsible development.-->
The seminar concludes by addressing fundamental questions about AI's capabilities,
the nature of machine intelligence, and its relationship to human consciousness.
