Dear Innovators, Visionaries &amp; Tech Enthusiasts of Silicon Valley,

Thanks to your enthusiastic participation and support, the first two K-PAI seminars were a resounding success!
The second seminar, in particular, brought together a number of remarkable professionals—engineers, scientists, market analysts, HR leaders, entrepreneurs, investors, and journalists—sparking vibrant discussions and active networking.
The energy was so palpable that it was hard to wrap up the event amidst the lively exchanges!
