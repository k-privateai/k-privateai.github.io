We are honored to welcome [Hyangja Yang](https://ko.wikipedia.org/wiki/%EC%96%91%ED%96%A5%EC%9E%90),
Former Member of the National Assembly (MNA) of South Korea, who will join our distinguished panel to share valuable insights on semiconductor policy and innovation in the global context. Her extensive experience in technology legislation will add a unique policy perspective to our discussion of software-silicon convergence.

<!--We are honored to welcome [Hyangja Yang](https://ko.wikipedia.org/wiki/%EC%96%91%ED%96%A5%EC%9E%90),
Former Member of the National Assembly (MNA) of South Korea,
as <font color="red">our distinguished panelist</font>.
Drawing from her extensive experience in technology policy and legislation,
Ms. Yang will provide unique insights into the global semiconductor landscape, addressing:

- The evolving geopolitical dynamics in the semiconductor industry
- Impact assessment of the CHIPS and Science Act under the Biden administration
- Potential policy shifts under the new Trump administration
- <font class="emph">The landmark K-Semiconductor bills she championed, and their role in strengthening South Korea's position in the global semiconductor and AI ecosystem!</font>

Her participation adds a crucial policy perspective to our discussion, bridging the gap between technological innovation and legislative frameworks that shape the future of the semiconductor industry.
