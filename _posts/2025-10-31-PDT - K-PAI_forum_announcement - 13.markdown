## K-PAI Leader's Perspectives


Contemporary discourse on AI ecosystems tends to focus heavily on visible layers—software services, algorithms, and applications—while overlooking the foundational infrastructure. Even within technical domains, **semiconductor and hardware infrastructure constitute the essential pillars of the AI ecosystem**: GPUs (Nvidia's dominance), HBM (SK hynix's breakthroughs), specialized AI semiconductors (NPUs, DPUs), and custom accelerators from tech giants. This landscape is increasingly shaped by geopolitical dynamics including the US-China technology competition, CHIPS Act, export controls, and supply chain restructuring. To understand and lead sustainable AI development, deep knowledge of the AI semiconductor ecosystem is absolutely essential.

The strategic partnership between K•ASIC and K-PAI transcends simple technical exchange—it illuminates the most foundational layer of the AI ecosystem while connecting Korea's and America's semiconductor innovation leadership. This is why we titled this forum **"The AI Silicon Race: Korea-US Innovation Leadership."** This event shares the core insight that AI's future is built not only on algorithms but on silicon, serving as a venue to explore sustainable development of the global AI ecosystem by consolidating the semiconductor capabilities of both nations.

### The Significance of the K-PAI × K•ASIC November Forum

Contemporary discourse on AI ecosystems tends to concentrate heavily on visible layers—AI software services like ChatGPT and Claude, algorithms like GPT-4o, software toolchains such as MCP, and application domains including biotech, robotics, physical AI, mobility, and industrial AI. While these are undeniably important, a comprehensive understanding of AI's landscape demands a far more multi-layered approach.

As the term "Artificial Intelligence" itself implies, properly understanding AI requires an interdisciplinary perspective that transcends pure technical domains. This necessarily includes humanistic and social science viewpoints—ethics, cognitive science, legal frameworks, and philosophical implications. AI is no longer the exclusive domain of technologists in specific fields, and indeed, it never could be.

Even when we confine our discussion to the technical realm, **semiconductor and hardware infrastructure constitute the foundational pillars of the AI ecosystem**—a critical dimension that demands careful examination.

The current AI hardware ecosystem comprises several essential components:

- **GPUs (Graphics Processing Units)**: Parallel processing accelerators led by Nvidia's market dominance
- **HBM (High Bandwidth Memory)**: Next-generation memory architectures that recently gained attention through SK hynix's remarkable 2,000% performance bonuses
- **Specialized AI Semiconductors**: Domain-specific chips including NPUs and DPUs that are even more optimized than GPUs
- **Custom AI Accelerators**: Domain-specific architectures designed in-house by major tech giants including Microsoft, OpenAI, Google, Amazon, Apple, and Meta

Notably, most of these companies function as fabless design houses, with actual fabrication outsourced to specialized foundries like TSMC. Furthermore, the semiconductor industry is inextricably linked to geopolitical variables, exemplified by the US-China technology competition. The CHIPS Act, export controls, and supply chain restructuring are fundamentally reshaping the industry landscape.

Therefore: **To understand and lead sustainable AI development, a deep understanding of hardware—particularly the AI semiconductor ecosystem—is absolutely essential.**

With this recognition, the strategic partnership between K•ASIC and K-PAI transcends simple technical exchange. This forum illuminates the most foundational layer of the AI ecosystem—silicon and semiconductor architecture—while functioning as a strategic platform connecting Korea's and America's AI semiconductor innovation leadership.

This is the fundamental reason we titled this forum **"The AI Silicon Race: Korea-US Innovation Leadership."** This event will share the core insight that AI's future is built not only on algorithms but on silicon, and will serve as a venue to explore sustainable development of the global AI ecosystem by consolidating the semiconductor capabilities of both Korea and the US.
