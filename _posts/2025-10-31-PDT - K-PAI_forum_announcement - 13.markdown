## K-PAI Leader's Perspectives


Contemporary discourse on AI ecosystems tends to focus heavily on visible layers—software services, algorithms, and applications—while overlooking the foundational infrastructure. Even within technical domains, **semiconductor and hardware infrastructure constitute the essential pillars of the AI ecosystem**: GPUs (Nvidia's dominance), HBM (SK hynix's breakthroughs), specialized AI semiconductors (NPUs, DPUs), and custom accelerators from tech giants. This landscape is increasingly shaped by geopolitical dynamics including the US-China technology competition, CHIPS Act, export controls, and supply chain restructuring. To understand and lead sustainable AI development, deep knowledge of the AI semiconductor ecosystem is absolutely essential.

The strategic partnership between K•ASIC and K-PAI transcends simple technical exchange—it illuminates the most foundational layer of the AI ecosystem while connecting Korea's and America's semiconductor innovation leadership. This is why we titled this forum **"The AI Silicon Race: Korea-US Innovation Leadership."** This event shares the core insight that AI's future is built not only on algorithms but on silicon, serving as a venue to explore sustainable development of the global AI ecosystem by consolidating the semiconductor capabilities of both nations.

## Opening Remarks (5:30pm ~ 5:40pm)

### Welcome Address

- **Speakers**: K-PAI Leadership &amp; K•ASIC Leadership
- **Time**: 5:30pm ~ 5:40pm

Join us as we officially open this historic K-PAI x K•ASIC Joint Seminar, celebrating the collaboration between two leading organizations in AI semiconductor innovation. This opening address will set the stage for an evening of cutting-edge insights into AI chip design, NPU architecture evolution, and the future of on-device AI.

## Presentations (5:40pm ~ 7:10pm)

### Main Keynote Session 1: From Semiconductor PPA Optimization to Physical AI - Library-Based Design Challenges and New Frontiers

- **Speaker**: [Naehyuck Chang](https://www.linkedin.com/in/naehyuck/){:target="_blank"}, Advisor and Former EVP of Samsung Electronics
- **Time**: 5:40pm ~ 6:10pm

Semiconductor design optimization has been a major source of competitiveness in the chip industry and has often had more impact than improvements in architecture or software. Even after many years of progress, the conventional layered design process still leaves room for improvement within standard cell libraries, which play a crucial role in determining power, performance, and area (PPA). The first part of this talk introduces a practical approach that uses artificial intelligence to improve cell library design and enhance PPA efficiency. The second part presents a future-oriented view of Physical AI, which combines control intelligence with physical systems, and introduces the concept of pretrained libraries, revealing new opportunities and challenges in applying library-based design and optimization methods to the next generation of intelligent physical systems.

As an ACM Fellow, IEEE Fellow, and former Technical Program Chair of the prestigious Design Automation Conference (DAC), Naehyuck brings unparalleled expertise in power and energy optimization from embedded systems to large-scale AI systems.
