# Invitation

Marketing Leaders, AI Innovators, and Digital Pioneers!

Yes! I knowâ€”K-PAI's 11th Chapter just wrapped up a few days ago, and now I'm already announcing the next one for next week? Before you wonder if I've lost my mind  &#x2605;^^&#x2605;, let me explain! September's forum had to shift to the end of the month due to speaker availability (you know how it is with FOUR busy thought leaders), and October's forum needed to jump to the beginning due to some logistics. But honestly? *<span style="color:red;">Two forums in quick succession just means double the innovation, double the networking, and double the excitementâ€”what's not to love?</span>*

Having said that,
we are thrilled to invite you to the Twelfth Edition of the [K-PAI Forum](/),
a premier gathering for researchers, industry leaders,
and innovators exploring the frontier of privacy-first AI technologies.
Following the tremendous success of our [{{ prev_announcement.title }}]({{ prev_announcement.url }}) forum,
this groundbreaking event explores how artificial intelligence is revolutionizing digital marketing and advertisingâ€”examining cutting-edge applications in video analysis, budget optimization, and intelligent ad targeting that are transforming how brands connect with audiences.

- **Date**: October 8, 2025 (Wednesday)
- **Time**: 5pm - 8pm PDT
- **Venue**: [Alaska @ KOTRA](https://maps.app.goo.gl/rodukzZGtDmz2XZM9)

Join us for an evening of transformative discussions, networking,
and visionary insights at the intersection of AI innovation and digital marketing!
Our forums have become a cornerstone for meaningful dialogue
in Silicon Valley's tech community, bringing together entrepreneurs, engineers, scientists, investors, marketing professionals,
and thought leaders who are shaping the future of intelligent advertising and customer engagement.

Check out [{{ reflection.title }}]({{ reflection.url }}) to see how our previous Power Paradigm event brought together energy experts from University of Michigan, Hanwha Qcells, PG&E, and National Renewable Energy Laboratory for transformative discussions on AI and energy systems!

<!--
This talk takes a high-altitude look at the evolution of online advertisingâ€”from early search ads to today's display ads, and retail/commerce ecosystems. We'll explore how AI and ML drive modern demand-side platforms (DSPs), from retrieval and ranking to auction mechanisms. The objective is to deepen our shared understanding of how these technologies are applied in adsâ€”without assuming pre-defined architectures or fixed rules.

Diko will take attendees on a comprehensive journey through the evolution of online advertising, examining how the industry has transformed from the early days of simple search ads to today's sophisticated display advertising systems and complex retail/commerce ecosystems. This high-altitude perspective will illuminate how AI and machine learning have become the driving force behind modern demand-side platforms (DSPs), exploring the intricate technical components including retrieval systems that identify relevant ad inventory, ranking algorithms that optimize ad placement, and sophisticated auction mechanisms that determine pricing and allocation in real-time.

Drawing from his extensive experience in engineering leadership at Toss USA, Diko will deepen our collective understanding of how these cutting-edge technologies are practically applied in the advertising industry. Rather than presenting rigid architectures or fixed rules, this presentation encourages dynamic thinking about how AI/ML systems can be designed and adapted to solve evolving challenges in digital advertising, providing attendees with frameworks for innovation in this rapidly changing landscape.
