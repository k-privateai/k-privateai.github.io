graciously provided by our sponsors! This welcoming atmosphere provides the perfect setting for meaningful connections and conversations while you engage with cybersecurity professionals, AI researchers, and industry leaders in an elegant setting.

## Featured Presentations (6pm ~ 7pm)

### The AI-Security Nexus
<!--: Navigating the Double-Edged Sword of Intelligent Systems-->

- **Speaker**: [Prof. Gail-Joon Ahn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gail-joon-ahn-3a59b411/), Professor @ [Arizona State University](https://asuonline.asu.edu/)
- **Time**: 6pm ~ 6:30pm

<!--As AI systems become increasingly sophisticated and pervasive, they present both unprecedented opportunities for enhancing cybersecurity and significant new attack vectors that threat actors are already exploiting. Professor Ahn will explore this fascinating duality, examining how AI is revolutionizing threat detection, incident response, and security automation while simultaneously creating novel vulnerabilities in adversarial machine learning, data poisoning, and model extraction attacks. Drawing from his extensive research in security and privacy, he will provide insights into building robust AI systems that can defend against both traditional cyber threats and emerging AI-specific attacks, while maintaining the privacy and integrity principles that are fundamental to trustworthy AI deployment.-->
