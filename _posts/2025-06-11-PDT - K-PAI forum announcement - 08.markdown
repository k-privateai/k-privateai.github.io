## Featured Presentations (6pm ~ 7pm)

### Robotics and AI in Everyday Life: From Vision to Reality

- Speaker: [John Suh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnsuh/), Founder &amp; Head of New Horizons Studio, Hyundai Motor Group
- Time: 6pm ~ 6:30pm

John will explore the transformative journey of robotics and AI technologies as they transition from laboratory concepts to practical daily applications. Drawing from his extensive experience in AI research and development, he will discuss current breakthroughs, real-world implementations, and the future landscape of intelligent robots and smart devices that seamlessly integrate into our homes, workplaces, and communities.

### Building Responsible AI, Robotics, and Agents

- Speaker: [Victor Cho](https://www.linkedin.com/in/victor-cho-/), CEO of [Emovid](https://www.emovid.com/)
- Time: 6:30pm ~ 7pm

<!--
Victor will delve into the critical principles and practices necessary for developing responsible AI systems, robotics, and autonomous agents. His presentation will cover ethical AI development frameworks, safety considerations in robotic systems, privacy-preserving approaches in smart device ecosystems, and the importance of human-centered design in creating AI companions that enhance rather than replace human capabilities.
-->

In this 30 minute discussion Victor will share a very simple framework for building responsible technology and businesses--whether it is robotic hardware systems or agentic software experiences. He will explain why responsibility is so critical in today's AI enabled world, and why building AI experiences that amplify vs. replace human capabilities should be the first step on our journey.
