# Invitation

---

Innovators, Technologists, and AI Enthusiasts!

We are thrilled to invite you to the eighth edition of the [K-PAI Forum](/),
a premier gathering for researchers, industry leaders,
and innovators exploring the frontier of privacy-first AI technologies.
Following the remarkable success of [our "Autonomous Alliance - AI Agents in a Connected World" forum](/seminar-reflections/07),
this event will explore how robots and smart devices are becoming integral companions in our daily lives—examining both the revolutionary opportunities and critical responsibility considerations in deploying these technologies while maintaining privacy and ethical standards.

- **Date**: June 18, 2025 (Wednesday)
- **Time**: 5pm - 8pm PDT
- **Venue**: [Altos Ventures](https://maps.app.goo.gl/R9ZQfxQocY7KSCC2A)

{% assign post = site.posts | where: "permalink", "/seminar-reflections/07" | first %}

Join us for an evening of insightful discussions, networking, and cutting-edge research at the intersection of robotics, smart devices, and responsible AI! Our forums have become a cornerstone for meaningful dialogue in Silicon Valley's tech community, bringing together entrepreneurs, engineers, scientists, investors, and thought leaders.

## Reception & Networking (5pm ~ 6pm)

Experience our signature networking reception featuring a luxurious sushi buffet dinner and premium beverages,
graciously provided by Altos Ventures! This exceptional culinary experience will provide the perfect atmosphere for meaningful connections and conversations while you enjoy gourmet cuisine in an elegant setting.

## Featured Presentations (6pm ~ 7pm)

### The Recipe for Imitation Learning in Self-Driving

- **Speaker**: [Cong Jie Ng](https://www.linkedin.com/in/congjie/), CTO of [Mars Auto](https://marsauto.com/)
- **Time**: 6pm ~ 6:30pm

This talk outlines the core challenges and essential components of applying imitation learning to end-to-end autonomous driving using camera input. Unlike traditional robotic manipulation tasks—where experts can explicitly demonstrate a wide range of recovery behaviors—self-driving requires robust handling of out-of-distribution situations such as lane deviations, which are rarely captured in expert demonstrations. This makes pure imitation learning in self-driving especially challenging. The talk will also discuss strategies industry leaders use to bridge this gap.

### Building Responsible AI, Robotics, and Agents

- **Speaker**: [Victor Cho](https://www.linkedin.com/in/victor-cho-/), CEO of [Emovid](https://www.emovid.com/)
- **Time**: 6:30pm ~ 7pm

In this 30-minute discussion, Victor will share a very simple framework for building responsible technology and businesses—whether it is robotic hardware systems or agentic software experiences. He will explain why responsibility is so critical in today's AI-enabled world, and why building AI experiences that amplify vs. replace human capabilities should be the first step on our journey.

## Q&A & Further Networking (7pm ~ 8pm)

The moments that all K-PAI participants love most!
