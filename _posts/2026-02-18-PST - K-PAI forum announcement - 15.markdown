# Invitation

K-PAI Community Members, Friends, Innovators, Energy Enthusiasts, and Investors!

⚡ **POWERING THE FUTURE WITH K-PAI!** ⚡

2026 has already started with incredible momentum! Our [historic New Year Celebration]({{ prev_announcement.url }}){:target="_blank"} brought our community together in ways we've never experienced before—with powerful reflections on leadership, record-breaking fundraising, and pure joy that reminded us why relationships are fundamental to everything we do.

Now we're ready to dive back into the cutting edge of technology—but with a twist!

We are **<span style="color: red;">thrilled</span>** to invite you to K-PAI's **<span style="color: red;">15th Forum</span>**—a unique dual-track exploration connecting the physical foundations of our AI future (battery technology) with the financial engines that bring innovation to market (venture capital and startup ecosystems).

But here's what makes this Forum truly special: **<span style="color: red;">2 FULL HOURS of energized networking!</span>**

After comprehensive presentations on battery science and investment wisdom, we're dedicating extended time for the kind of **active, interactive, energized networking you can only experience at K-PAI**. Connect with battery engineers, AI researchers, investors, founders, legal professionals, and fellow innovators in an environment designed for meaningful conversations and lasting relationships.

- **Date**: 25-Feb-2026 (wed)
- **Time**: 5pm - 9pm
- **Venue**: [LG Silicon Valley Lab](https://maps.app.goo.gl/dzcZgvV8ytgCFxq48){:target="_blank"} (South Entrance)
- **Dinner Sponsor**: **[Erudio Bio Korea, Inc.](https://www.erudio.bio/)**

## Why This Forum Matters

As AI scales exponentially, two questions become increasingly critical!

1. **Where will the energy come from?** Battery technology isn't just about electric vehicles—it's about energy storage infrastructure, grid modernization, renewable integration, and the portable power that enables edge AI and autonomous systems.

1. **How do breakthrough technologies reach global scale?** The journey from innovation to impact requires more than brilliant engineering—it demands strategic capital, market understanding, and the hard-earned wisdom of those who've built companies across continents.

[Feb-2026 K-PAI Forum]({{ page.url }}) brings both perspectives together in one evening, followed by the networking time to forge connections that bridge technical excellence and business reality.

# Event Schedule: Built for Connection

This Forum features a networking-optimized format:

| Time | Activity |
|------|----------|
| 5pm - 5:30pm | **Registration & Early Networking** |
| 5:30pm - 6:10pm | **Talk 1: Battery Technology Deep Dive** + Q&A |
| 6:10pm - 6:50pm | **Talk 2: Investment Landscape & Founder Journey** + Q&A |
| 6:50pm - 7pm | **MiSook Chung: K-PAI Groups Initiative** |
| 7pm - 9pm | **🎉 Extended Networking Dinner (2 Full Hours!) 🎉** |

**Why are we dedicating 2 hours to networking?**

At our New Year Party, we learned something profound - the most valuable experiences happen not just when we're learning *about* technology, but when we're connecting *with* the people building it. The conversations during dinner, the spontaneous collaborations, the "you should meet..." introductions—these moments create lasting value.

So this Forum is designed to give you time. Time to find your future co-founder. Time to discover your next investor or advisor. Time to connect with someone working on the exact technical challenge you're facing. Time to build relationships that matter.

**Come for the insights. Stay for the connections. Leave with relationships that last.**

## Talk 1: Understanding Lithium-Ion Battery Technology, Safety, Manufacturing, and Market Trends

**Speaker**: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/naehyuck/">Nathan Chang</a> - SVP at Samsung Electronics DSRA, ACM Fellow, and IEEE Fellow

This talk begins with the fundamentals of lithium-ion chemistry, cell architecture, and performance trade-offs between energy, power, lifetime, and safety. It then examines manufacturing processes, cost drivers, yield challenges, and scaling constraints that shape real-world competitiveness. We connect these technical and manufacturing realities to current market trends, including chemistry transitions, supply chain pressures, regional competition, and long-term cost evolution.

As artificial intelligence drives unprecedented computational demand and clean energy transitions reshape global infrastructure, battery technology emerges as a critical bottleneck and opportunity. This comprehensive session examines lithium-ion batteries from first principles to market realities.

**What Makes This Relevant to K-PAI!**

Battery technology intersects with K-PAI's core themes in unexpected ways.

- **AI-driven optimization** - Battery manufacturing, supply chain logistics, and performance prediction increasingly leverage ML
- **Energy infrastructure** - The power demands of AI datacenters connect directly to grid-scale storage
- **Privacy-preserving collaboration** - Battery companies share operational data through federated learning to improve processes without exposing IP
- **Korean technological leadership** - Korea's battery manufacturers (LG, Samsung, SK) represent some of the nation's most advanced manufacturing and R&D capabilities

This talk provides the technical depth and market context to understand why batteries matter—not just for EVs, but for the entire AI-enabled, electrified future we're building.

## Talk 2: Seoul to Silicon Valley - Lessons Learned as a Founder and Investor

**Speaker**: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidleexg/">David Lee</a> - Investor, Entrepreneur, Tech &amp; Media Exec, Producer

Join David Lee—prolific investor, tech executive, entrepreneur and one of Google’s first 200 employees—for an inside look at the his journey and lessons learned from the Silicon Valley venture capital and startup ecosystems.

Drawing on his experience backing over 150 companies, including giants like Facebook, Twitter, Wish and companies in Korea such as Olaworks and Miso, David provides a high-level investor’s perspective on what truly moves the needle for global operators. From the fundamentals of scaling to the current AI explosion with Poseidon and Higgsfield, he will share his experiences as an investor and entrepreneur for founders navigating the 2026 Silicon Valley landscape.

In this candid session, David shares hard-won lessons from two decades at the intersection of technology, capital, and entrepreneurship.

**What Makes This Relevant to K-PAI!**

Many K-PAI members are founders, aspiring founders, or early employees at startups. David's perspective offers something rare: a view from inside the room where investment decisions happen, informed by actual operational experience building companies.

Whether you're seeking funding, considering joining a startup, evaluating career moves, or simply curious about how Silicon Valley actually works behind the buzzwords—this session provides unfiltered insights from someone who has seen it all, succeeded and failed, and kept building anyway.

## Special Session: K-PAI Groups Initiative

**Presented by** <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/misook-chung/">MiSook Chung</a> - Former HR Leader @ Micron, Wharton CHRO, Connecting People, Purpose & Innovation

After our talks, MiSook Chung will introduce **K-PAI's organic groups (소모임) initiative**—a framework for members to self-organize around shared interests, professional goals, and personal passions.

**Why this matters?**

Our New Year Party taught us something important - K-PAI's value isn't just in quarterly forums—it's in ongoing relationships. K-PAI Groups provide structure for those relationships to deepen between our main events.

By the time we transition to dinner, you'll have everything you need to either join an existing group or start your own!

*For more information, visit our [Groups page](/groups){:target="_blank"} showcasing existing K-PAI Groups and their activities.*
