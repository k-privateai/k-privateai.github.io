# Transformative Presentations on AI in Biomedicine

## Dr. HoJoon Lee's Precision Medicine Revolution

<!--blockquote>
&ldquo;DATA IS KING&rdquo; has been a recurring theme
&mdash; from cancer vaccines to early detection &mdash;
re-affirming that deep learning + big biological data = precision decisions
</blockquote-->

[Dr. HoJoon Lee](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hojoonlee/) from Stanford University School of Medicine
delivered a compelling presentation on the integration of AI-driven genomics and image analysis for precision medicine. His talk systematically walked attendees through the evolution of deep learning in the biomedical field, from AlexNet in 2012 to today's advanced transformer models processing massive biomedical datasets.

Particularly illuminating was Dr. Lee's explanation of how various types of biomedical data—genomic, proteomic, electronic health records, medical images, and wearable device data—are being integrated through AI to provide unprecedented insights. The presentation highlighted how The Cancer Genome Atlas, with its comprehensive data on over 11,000 samples across 33 cancer types, has become a cornerstone resource for training AI models to identify patterns invisible to human researchers.

</div>

Dr. Lee's case study on colon cancer treatment was especially impactful. He demonstrated how AI analysis of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) could predict which patients would respond to immunotherapy, addressing the critical challenge that only about 20% of patients currently benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitors. By using deep learning to identify neoantigens from genomic data and assess TILs from histopathological images, his team has developed models that significantly improve treatment selection for individual patients.

## Dr. Donghoon Kim's Medical Imaging Innovations

<!--blockquote>
His work opens a path to &ldquo;non-invasive, scalable early diagnosis&rdquo; — especially crucial for neurological disorders like AD, where early intervention is vital.
</blockquote-->

[Dr. Donghoon Kim](https://www.linkedin.com/in/donghoon-kim-983149151/)
from Stanford's Center for Advanced Functional Neuroimaging (CAFN)
complemented the genomics perspective with a comprehensive overview of AI applications in medical imaging. His presentation highlighted the rapid progression from basic classification tasks to today's sophisticated systems that can predict disease progression from imaging data alone.

Most impressive were the practical applications Dr. Kim demonstrated, including:

- A deep learning model that reduces MRI scan time by 56% while maintaining diagnostic quality, making vital scans more accessible and comfortable for patients
- AI systems that can synthesize PET images from MRI scans, potentially eliminating radiation exposure for certain diagnostic procedures
- Vision-language models that can predict amyloid and tau status in Alzheimer's patients from standard MRI scans, offering a non-invasive alternative to specialized PET scans that are often inaccessible outside major medical centers

<img src="/resource/seminars/06 - 22-Apr-2025/photos/KakaoTalk_Photo_2025-04-23-22-02-34 022.jpeg">
</div>

Dr. Kim's work exemplified how AI is not only enhancing existing imaging capabilities but enabling entirely new diagnostic approaches that were previously impossible. His emphasis on foundation models that can be fine-tuned for specific tasks demonstrated the field's evolution toward more generalized AI systems that can handle multiple healthcare applications.

# Cross-Disciplinary Dialogue

The evening culminated in K-PAI premium networking session that evolved from formal questioning into genuine multidisciplinary dialogue.
A particularly memorable moment occurred when a privacy engineer posed a question about genomic data anonymization,
and a healthcare administrator responded sharing a real-world implementation challenge.
This sparked a three-way conversation highlighting the practical tensions between privacy protection, clinical utility, and regulatory compliance.

This spontaneous exchange exemplified the value of bringing together specialists from different fields who rarely have opportunities to directly engage with each other's perspectives. The conversation revealed how solutions developed in isolation often fail to account for the full complexity of healthcare delivery systems.

# Key Takeaways

Four major themes emerged from the event:

- <strong>Multidisciplinary Imperative</strong>
&ndash; The event underscored that meaningful progress in this space requires genuine collaboration across disciplines, with AI researchers, medical professionals, privacy experts, and regulatory specialists all bringing crucial perspectives to the table.

- <strong>Patient-Centered Innovation</strong>
&ndash; Discussions consistently returned to the importance of keeping patient benefits at the center of technological development, emphasizing that privacy-preserving AI must ultimately be judged by its ability to improve healthcare outcomes while respecting individual rights.

- <strong>Privacy as Enabler, Not Obstacle</strong>
&ndash; A recurring theme was the reframing of privacy enhancement from a limitation to an enabler that unlocks access to sensitive datasets previously unavailable for research and analysis. This perspective shift is critical for advancing both innovation and adoption.

# Personal Reflections

What I found most valuable from the event was witnessing the practical demonstrations of privacy-preserving methods for medical data analysis. Dr. Lee's approach to analyzing genomic data and medical images while maintaining privacy safeguards addressed precisely the challenge my team has been grappling with in our current projects. The concrete examples of privacy-first implementations already showing results in clinical settings provided several ideas I'm eager to explore with colleagues.

The event raised important questions about balancing computational requirements with real-time needs in urgent care settings, standardizing privacy protections across international boundaries, and designing accountability frameworks that appropriately distribute responsibility between human practitioners and AI systems. As regulatory frameworks continue to evolve over the next few years, these questions will become increasingly pressing.

For my own work, the federated learning techniques discussed by Dr. Kim offer a promising framework for training models across multiple hospital systems without requiring sensitive patient data to leave local environments. Similarly, the differential privacy approaches mentioned during the spotlight sessions could enhance our public health monitoring system that needs to identify population-level trends while guaranteeing individual anonymity.

# Conclusion

The 6th K-PAI Forum exemplified why community-driven events are so valuable to Silicon Valley's innovation ecosystem. By bringing together specialists from privacy-first AI and biomedical fields, the partnership between K-PAI and K-BioX created a unique environment where theoretical concepts could be grounded in practical healthcare challenges, and technical solutions evaluated against real-world human needs.

What distinguished this forum from typical tech events was the genuine multidisciplinary dialogue that emerged throughout the evening. Rather than staying in silos of expertise, participants eagerly crossed boundaries to explore how their knowledge could complement others' skills in addressing the complex challenges of implementing AI in healthcare while preserving privacy.

The forum demonstrated that the most promising innovations in healthcare AI will come from collaboration guided by shared values of privacy, security, and improved patient outcomes.
As [K-PAI](/) continues its series with upcoming events on
"The Autonomous Alliance - AI Agents in a Connected World" (21-May-2025)
and
"Silicon Companions - Robots and Smart Devices in Daily Life" (18-Jun-2025)
this model of cross-domain knowledge exchange will remain essential for developing technologies that are both powerful and responsible.
