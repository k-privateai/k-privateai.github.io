This talk is particularly valuable for technical professionals who need to understand the legal framework governing their AI development work.

### Agency in a New World Order - AI and Humanism in &ldquo;Musical Counterpoint&rdquo;

- **Speaker**: [James Rhee](https://www.redhelicopter.com/about-james) with [Jennifer Kim Lin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jennifer-kim-lin-19a87a2/)
- **Language**: English
- **Time**: 6:40pm ~ 7:10pm

James will present a visionary exploration of how we can preserve and enhance human agency in an AI-dominated world through the lens of "musical counterpoint"—where different voices maintain their independence while creating harmony together. Drawing from his transformative leadership experience and bestselling book insights, he'll examine how humanistic principles can guide AI development and organizational leadership. This presentation will explore the concept of "Joo-duh-sung" (주도성/Agency) and demonstrate how AI and human intelligence can work in counterpoint rather than replacement. Jennifer Kim Lin will conclude the session with a brief demonstration of a beta application that makes these humanistic AI principles tangible and actionable for attendees.
