Dear Innovators, Visionaries &amp; Tech Enthusiasts of Silicon Valley,

<!--Thanks to your active participations and support,
we have held the first two K-PAI seminars successfully.-->
Thanks to your enthusiastic participation and support, the first two K-PAI seminars were a resounding success!
<!--
Especially, for the second seminar,
more than 35 innovators and tech enthusiasts
such as
engineers, scientists, market analysts, HR professionals, entrepreneurs, investors, and even journalists
came to learn and activately interact with other professionals.-->
The second seminar, in particular, brought together a number of remarkable professionals—engineers, scientists, market analysts, HR leaders, entrepreneurs, investors, and journalists—sparking vibrant discussions and active networking.
<!-- It was hard to disperse the crowd in the middle of
active networking. :) -->
The energy was so palpable that it was hard to wrap up the event amidst the lively exchanges!
(Check out our reflections on the [2nd K-PAI Seminar](/seminar-reflections/02/).
