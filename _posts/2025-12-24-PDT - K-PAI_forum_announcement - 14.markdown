## The Year in Review - Reflections on 13 Transformative Chapters (6pm ~ 6:15pm)

**2025 - A Year of Milestones and Growth**

[Prof. Jung Hee Cheon](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jungheecheon/){:target="_blank"}
will reflect on K-PAI's remarkable journey through 2025.
From our historic partnerships with KOTRA SV
and
exploring AI's energy sustainability challenges
to
examining semiconductor foundations—he'll weave together the threads connecting our 13 forums into a coherent narrative of community growth and technical evolution.

<span class="emph">This isn't just a chronological recap; it's a meditation on how K-PAI has matured from technical education into strategic discourse, from event series into genuine community, from local gathering into international bridge between Korean and Silicon Valley AI ecosystems.</span>

## Community Voice (Part 1) - The Immigrants Paradox (6:15pm ~ 6:30pm)

**Why Korean Engineers Win the Job but Lose the Leadership Story**

[Sue Kim](https://www.linkedin.com/in/suekimpr/){:target="_blank"}
will address a critical challenge facing our community: why many Korean engineers remain underrecognized in leadership tracks—not due to capability, but due to narrative, visibility, and cultural communication gaps.

Drawing from her 25+ years of experience working closely with U.S. CEOs and executive teams in Silicon Valley's semiconductor industry, Sue will explore
• how technical excellence alone doesn't guarantee leadership recognition
• the role of narrative, storytelling, and executive communication in career advancement
• cultural communication gaps that hinder visibility and sponsorship
• practical strategies for self-advocacy and building executive presence
• the importance of broadening diverse voices within our community.

<span class="emph">Sue's presentation bridges individual career development with K-PAI's community aspirations—reminding us that our collective success depends on creating pathways where Korean engineers not only excel technically but also lead strategically, shaping the future of technology with their unique perspectives and voices.</span>

This segment naturally flows into broader community aspirations: What does [K-PAI](/) need to do to support members' professional growth? How can we collectively address systemic barriers? What dreams do members harbor for what [K-PAI](/) might become?

## Community Voice (Part 2) - The Philosophy of Community Recognition (6:30pm ~ 6:45pm)

**What Makes Our Community Exceptional**

[MiSook Chung](https://www.linkedin.com/in/misook-chung/){:target="_blank"}
will share reflections on what defines excellence in our community—the values we celebrate, the contributions that matter, and the spirit that makes K-PAI more than just a professional network. This presentation will frame the evening's awards ceremony, articulating the philosophy behind how we recognize and honor outstanding community members.

MiSook's humanistic perspective will remind us that an advanced AI community is defined not by technological sophistication alone, but by how we use innovation to serve humanity with compassion, dignity, and wisdom.

<span class="emph">This segment sets the conceptual foundation for understanding why certain contributions deserve celebration, and what we collectively aspire to embody as a community.</span>

## Vision 2026 - K-PAI's Strategic Direction (6:45pm ~ 7pm)

**Where We're Heading - Themes, Partnerships, and Ambitions**

[Chanik Park](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chanik-park-14878b32/){:target="_blank"}
will articulate K-PAI's vision for 2026—the themes we'll explore, the partnerships we'll cultivate, the initiatives we'll launch, and the impact we aspire to create. Building on 2025's foundation (strategic alliance with KOTRA SV and established presence as Silicon Valley's premier AI discourse venue), what new frontiers await?

Expect insights into
• planned forum themes addressing emerging AI challenges
• potential new strategic partnerships expanding K-PAI's ecosystem
• community initiatives deepening member engagement and collaboration
• international dimensions connecting global AI innovation hubs
• mechanisms for translating K-PAI insights into actionable impact.

<span class="emph">This session invites YOUR input! Chanik's vision provides direction, but K-PAI's future is collectively shaped. Your participation tonight literally influences what topics we explore, which partnerships we pursue, and how our community evolves.</span>

## Holistic Synthesis - The AI Landscape through [K-PAI](/)'s Lens (7pm ~ 7:15pm)

**13 Forums, One Coherent Vision - Connecting the Dots**

What insights emerge when we synthesize 13 forums spanning security, ethics, law, energy, marketing, semiconductors, and more? How do these apparently diverse topics actually interconnect into a coherent understanding of responsible AI development? What patterns become visible when we step back and view the complete landscape?

[Sunghee Yun](https://sungheeyun.github.io/)
will provide a **holistic meta-analysis** drawing connections across
• **technical layers** - from algorithms and applications down through semiconductors to energy infrastructure
• **disciplinary domains** - how legal frameworks, ethical principles, business models, and technical architectures mutually constrain and enable each other
• **temporal dimensions** - how 2025's explorations lay groundwork for 2026's inquiries
• **geopolitical contexts** - Korea-US partnerships as model for international AI cooperation
• **human dimensions** - agency, dignity, privacy, and human flourishing as through-lines across all forums.

<span class="emph">This synthesis demonstrates that [K-PAI](/)'s true value lies not in individual forums but in cumulative understanding—building systems-level comprehension where each new perspective enriches appreciation of all others.</span>

<span style="color: red;">Expect frameworks, mental models, and conceptual architectures that help organize and integrate the rich knowledge we've collectively absorbed throughout 2025.</span>

## The First Annual [K-PAI](/) Community Awards! 🏆 (7:15pm ~ 7:30pm)

## The [K-PAI](/) Community Auction! 🎨 (7:30pm ~ 8pm)

**Supporting Our Community While Having Fun**

Here's something completely new and exciting—**a community auction** featuring items donated by [K-PAI](/) members themselves!

<h3>Why We're Holding This Auction</h3>

This auction represents more than fundraising—it's a strategic initiative to ensure [K-PAI](/)'s long-term sustainability and expanding impact. The funds raised will be allocated across three essential pillars:

**1. Organizational Sustainability**
Basic non-profit operations including tax filing, bookkeeping, and administrative infrastructure that keep [K-PAI](/) running professionally and compliantly.

**2. Enhanced Member Value**
Travel stipends to bring world-class speakers we couldn't otherwise afford, mentorship programs for entrepreneurship and career development, and resources that directly benefit our community members.

**3. Societal Impact**
Establishing the "K-PAI Scholarship" and collaborating with organizations focused on gender equality, equitable technology access, and addressing AI-era inequality challenges—extending [K-PAI](/)'s positive influence beyond our immediate community.

By participating in this auction—whether as donor or bidder—you're directly investing in [K-PAI](/)'s ability to serve not just our members, but the broader cause of responsible, humanistic, and inclusive AI development.

<h3>How It Works</h3>

to privacy-preserving techniques—building holistic understanding of AI's responsible development across technical, ethical, legal, and societal dimensions.

But beyond the content, we've created something even more valuable: **a community where genuine connections emerge, where diverse perspectives enrich understanding, where collaboration happens naturally, and where innovation thrives at disciplinary intersections**. This celebration honors not just our technical achievements but the human connections that make K-PAI truly special.

<span class="emph">So this evening is not about presentations—it's about US. About recognizing each other's contributions. About strengthening bonds. About laughing together. About envisioning our collective future. About celebrating what we've built and what we'll create together.</span>

## Beyond Forums - A Community Coming Alive!

While our 13 forums provided the intellectual foundation, **the real magic of 2025 happened in the spaces between**—in the spontaneous group meetings, the strategic partnerships, the personal transformations, and the exponential community growth that turned [K-PAI](/) from an event series into a living, breathing ecosystem!

### Strategic Activities &amp; Partnerships

**[K-PAI Activities](/activities)** demonstrates our expanding influence beyond monthly forums:

**🏛️ Silicon Valley Expert Roundtable with Korean National Assembly Members** (October 7, 2025) - **COMPLETED**

[K-PAI](/) mobilized our community's expertise for high-level policy dialogue! As part of our strategic alliance with KOTRA Silicon Valley, we recruited and coordinated Silicon Valley experts across multiple disciplines to engage with four National Assembly members focused on AI policy, the AI-specialized consul, and representatives from major tech companies. <span class="emph">This exemplifies [K-PAI](/)'s unique ability to bridge Silicon Valley technical excellence with Korean policymaking—creating tangible impact beyond academic discourse.</span>

This exemplifies [K-PAI](/)'s expanding role as strategic connector between practitioners and policymakers.

**🎓 Korea University Business School (KUBS) Partnership Initiative** - **UNDER DEVELOPMENT**

Following [Sunghee](https://sungheeyun.github.io)'s AI seminar series at KUBS, we're developing an innovative online roundtable series connecting KUBS professors with [K-PAI](/) members. The opportunity: bridging academic rigor with Silicon Valley's practical AI implementation know-how. KUBS brings theoretical frameworks and organizational studies; [K-PAI](/) brings data-driven methodologies and real-world applications. This interdisciplinary collaboration opens doors for members to engage meaningfully in industry-academia joint projects!

**🎮 Joint Hackathon with Krafton (PUBG Developers)** - **UNDER DEVELOPMENT**

An exciting collaboration emerging from serendipitous connections! Krafton's 100+ AI/ML PhD team is planning a Silicon Valley visit, and preliminary discussions point toward a co-hosted hackathon. Imagine: Krafton's game development AI expertise + [K-PAI](/)'s AI knowledge + Silicon Valley's collaborative innovation culture = breakthrough solutions at the intersection of gaming, AI, and technology innovation!

### Organic Group Meetings - Community Self-Organization

[**K-PAI Groups**](/groups) showcases something truly special—**members spontaneously organizing their own gatherings**! This organic growth signals genuine community vitality:

- **November 4th**: The **FIRST** K-PAI Bio/Medical/Data group meeting in Mountain View (Chanik, Insuk, Mitch, Minha, Sunghee)
- **November 10th**: K-PAI meets KABANC in Palo Alto (Daniel, Hayden, Jeff, Sunghee)
- **November 14th**: Interdisciplinary gathering in Berkeley—lawyers, judges, engineers, scientists, entrepreneurs!
- **November 15th**: K-PAI + Institute for Information Communication Technology Planning and Evaluation (IITP) in Morgan Hill
- **November 27th**: Early morning breakfast in Seoul (June Hee, Chanik, Sunghee)
- **December 5th**: Flash meetup in Santa Clara (Jae Chul, Goonho, Wonpyo, Sunghee)

<font color="red">These weren't organized by [K-PAI](/) leadership—members themselves initiated these connections! This is how genuine professional communities evolve: from scheduled forums to spontaneous collaboration emerging naturally from shared interests and mutual respect.</font>

### Personal Transformations: Individual Impact Stories

[**To Me, K-PAI is...**](/kptm/) captures profound personal journeys enabled by our community:

<!--
**Hyein Kim** (Visiting Student): *"K-PAI truly made my semester in San Francisco more meaningful, connected, and exciting."* One semester, transformative connections—from Plug and Play invitations to partnership opportunities for the Korea-America Student Conference (KASC) focusing on semiconductors and AI collaboration.

**MiSook Chung** (Community Visionary): *"K-PAI embodies a community where curiosity meets conscience, and where conversations about AI are ultimately conversations about humanity."* Her reflection on Margaret Mead's healed femur story reminds us: an advanced AI society isn't defined by how intelligent our machines become, but by how responsibly and compassionately we use technology to serve humanity.

**Gordon Park** (Bio Researcher): *"바이오는 CS 분야의 도움을 통해 이해해야 하는 시대가 이미 왔다고 생각합니다."* (Bio requires CS understanding—that era has arrived.) K-PAI provides exactly this intersection, helping bio researchers navigate the data-driven AI landscape while reducing bias and improving accuracy through interdisciplinary collaboration.

**Ik-Jung (Joe) Kim** (Startup Founder): Perhaps the most dramatic transformation—when registering for K-PAI, Joe spontaneously created his company name and wrote "CEO" in the title field. *That moment became the start of his entrepreneurial journey!* Through K-PAI connections, he gained the network and inspiration to grow his startup step by step.

### Explosive Committee Growth: 4 → 20! 🚀

Perhaps the most tangible evidence of [K-PAI](/)'s evolution: **[our committee](/committee) has quintupled from 4 original organizers to 20 dedicated members** ★^^★

<!--
**Organizing Committee** (4 members):
Jung Hee Cheon, Chanik Park, Sunghee Yun, Daejun Park

**Operating Committee** (7 members):
Jun Yeong Jang, Hyun Jung Noh, Christine Cho, Alex Moon, Jaehyeok Bae, Sehui Jeong, Hagoon Jang

**Program Committee** (9 members):
Siyeon Rhee, MiSook Chung, Daniel Hur, Austin Jin, Haeyun Kim, Seyoung Choi, Sue Kim, Kain Sunwoo, Joohyeun Yi

This 5x growth demonstrates:

- **Diverse skill sets** spanning operations, programming, and strategic planning
- **Community investment** where members volunteer substantial time because they believe in K-PAI's mission

### The Compound Effect

When you combine:
- 13 transformative forums covering AI's complete landscape
- Strategic partnerships with KOTRA SV, K•ASIC, KUBS, Krafton
- High-level policy engagement (National Assembly roundtables)
- Organic group meetings self-organizing across specializations
- Individual member transformations (students → professionals, professionals → entrepreneurs)
- Committee scaling 5x (4 → 20 dedicated volunteers)
- **[Membership structure](/membership)** formalizing community tiers and benefits

<!--
What emerges is **exponentially more valuable than the sum of parts**. K-PAI has become a platform where:
- **Technical innovation** meets **humanistic values**
- **Korean heritage** bridges **Silicon Valley culture**
- **Individual growth** compounds into **collective impact**
- **Formal structure** enables **organic spontaneity**
- **Professional networking** deepens into **genuine friendship**

This is what we're celebrating on January 14th—not just 13 forums, but the **complete ecosystem** those forums enabled. An ecosystem that now has its own momentum, generating value through connections and collaborations we never could have predicted or orchestrated centrally.
