### Things that were discussed and agreed!

- We said we were going to expand our committee members &amp; volunteers
to reduce each member's work load and at the same time, make the running of the org more effective and efficient
- We will regularly have this type of fun meetings!
- We are constantly getting great feedback - quality of the talks are amazing (compared to other meetings in Silicon Valley), which [Sunghee](https://sungheeyun.github.io) could not agree more,
extremely friendly atmosphere, open to everyone, etc.
- We will need to extract younger demography, though.
- Right, [Hagoon](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hagoon-jang-79766a54/) joined the committee! Finally! Yeah! :)
