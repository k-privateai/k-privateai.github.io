### Agenda

Planning for K-PAI's 2026 New Year Celebration (14-Jan-2026) covering performance coordination, donation mechanisms, auction logistics, interactive games, and community awards.

### Decisions Made

#### 1. Performance Program
- **Recruitment approach**: Voluntary participation from community members
- **Incentive**: Performers will receive priority acquisition rights in the auction

#### 2. Donation Framework
- **Donation categories**:
  - Game prizes (noted by [K-PAI](/) members)
  - Auction items ([K-PAI](/) members donate items for auction)
  - Direct monetary contributions (voluntary, *e.g.*, using venmo QR code)
- **Implementation for January event**:
  - QR code will be embedded somewhere every can see while entering Alaska and in presentation slides for one-time monetary donations
  - After non-profit organization registration: establish corporate donation account for ongoing contributions
- **Transparency**: All donation mechanisms will be clearly communicated to attendees

#### 3. Auction Program
- **Target goal**: $10,000 (example fundraising target)
- **Item donation rule**:
  - income will be donated to [K-PAI](/)

#### 4. Interactive Games
- **Format**: Quiz utilizing presentation materials, *etc.*
- **Purpose**: Educational engagement + networking facilitation

#### 5. Community Awards
- **Selection method**: Committee-based selection (voting deemed inappropriate due to insufficient candidate information across full membership)
- **Award philosophy**:
  - Pre-ceremony statement explaining award purpose and selection criteria
  - Statement will be delivered by [Sunghee](https://sungheeyun.github.io) and [MiSook](https://www.linkedin.com/in/misook-chung/){:target="_blank"}
  - Emphasis on celebrating community spirit and diverse contributions
- **Categories**: Multiple awards recognizing different dimensions of community participation (up to 3 awards)

| **Make proper announcement with what is discussed in the meeting** | [Sunghee](https://sungheeyun.github.io) | 27-Dec-2025 | H |

### Key Principles Established

1. **Community-driven**: All programs emphasize voluntary participation and community ownership
2. **Transparency**: Clear communication about donation mechanisms and fund usage
3. **Celebration-focused**: Awards and recognition celebrate diverse contributions rather than creating competitive dynamics
4. **Engagement-oriented**: Games and activities designed to facilitate meaningful networking alongside entertainment

### Next Steps

- Committee to finalize specific award categories
- Begin soliciting auction item donations from members on 27-Dec-2025
- Prepare award philosophy statement articulating K-PAI's values and community spirit
- Design quiz content leveraging 2025 forum highlights

- We will regularly have this type of fun meetings!
- We are constantly getting great feedback - quality of the talks are amazing (compared to other meetings in Silicon Valley), which [Sunghee](https://sungheeyun.github.io) could not agree more,
extremely friendly atmosphere, open to everyone, etc.
