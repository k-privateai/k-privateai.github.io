Yes, we ARE holding 2025 K-PAI Best Ownership Award at the end of this year!
&ndash;
we don't know exactly when and how (yet ^^)!

K-PAI has become one of the most famous and popular Forums in Silicon Valley.
Considering that we started this only a year ago,
this is amazing accomplishment.
When we first searched for sponsors for January Forum,
we thought there may be some chance
that we will get sponsorship, e.g., for dinner after one year
if we do this right.
However, it only took a few months to hear from the first voluntary sponsor,
LG Electronics Silicon Valley! (Thank you LG Electronics for that!)
Then KOTRA, then the famous Altos Ventures!
(Their definition of Luxury Sushi Buffet was totally different from my definition! ^^ SWAK!)
Then Erudio Bio, Inc., UClone, and MangoBoost to name a few!

As was observed in Sep-2025 historic Forum,
the historic Perpetual Partnership between K-PAI and KOTRA Silicon Valley
as a form of Strategic Alliances
came so unexpectedly.
I cannot find proper words to describe my excitement and sense of achievement and being recognized
among great talents in Silicon Valley
when I heard from Haeyun Kim and Oh Hyoung Kown of KOTRA
that to see this naturally and organically growing organization
is a quite amazing and pleasant experience.
Yes, they wanted not one time co-hosting, but *perpetual* partnership!
My feeling was just undescrible!

Now for the first half of 2026,
we will co-host FOUR of our six Forums
with K-BioX, K-ASIC, KOTRA Silicon Valley, and Consulate General of Republic of Korea located in San Francisco! :)
Moreover, all SIX months sponsorship has been secured!
Isn't this amazing?

However, I know that without K-PAI Members' help and devotion,
NONE of these would've been possible!
So as a token of appreciation for your sacrifice, devotion, and selfless enthusiasm not for themselves, but for others,
we want to throw K-PAI Best Awards Ceremony!

# [Sunghee](https://sungheeyun.github.io){:target="_blank"} recommends MiSook!

> MiSook showed great confidence and sacrifice arranging and organizing Aug-2025 Forum
> and making it happen to invite James Rhee, the author of Red Helicopter.
> I had pre-prep meeting with her (and Jennifer and still other amazing women) at Paris Baguette one day.
> During the 3 full hours, we brainstormed quite a lot of great ideas
> including Jennifer's introducing Red Helicopter platform to people at the K-PAI Forum.
> Then MiSook followed up with lots of details.
> Coincidently, I was going through the busiest time ever with Erudio Bio, Inc. and founding a new company,
> Erudio Bio Korean, Inc. while going back and forth between US and Korea and appealing to Gates Foundation at the same time,
> so I could not spend much time on the planning,
> hence, without MiSook's enthusiastic devotion with her belief and confidence in Humanity
> and belief that technology should exist for humans, not the other way around it,
> none of these would have been possible.
>
> The second remote meeting happened during my biz trip to NY. I vividly remember
> syncing with James while driving with Jennifer near Yale,
> MiSook in West Coast,
> and Me in Manhattan.
> We enjoyed so much discussing which subjects James should deliver to Aug-2025 Forum
> and how we could effectively convey James's amazing messages.
>
> Then MiSook helped find a place for James to stay while staying in Silicon Valley
> for his visit for K-PAI Forum,
> drove James back and forth from the airport to everywhere!
> MiSook even arranged a meeting with Prof. GiWook Shin at Stanford University,
> who is a renowned professor,
> which I also joined. MiSook seemed to try her best to maximally utilize this chance of James visiting Bay Area!
> We had amazingly productive and fruitful conversation.
> I saw tremendous potential for the future synergy between them
> in making this world a better place!
>
> MiSook is one of those whom I really truly from the deep down of my heart want to work with as a K-PAI Committee Member!
>
> For the aforementioned reasons,
> I strongly recommend MiSook for 2025 K-PAI Best Ownership Awards nomination!

# [Sunghee](https://sungheeyun.github.io){:target="_blank"} recommends Daniel Huh!

> Not very much did I expect from (or rather hope for) Daniel
> when we had coffee chat to brainstorm and talk about
> the possibility of Daniel's being in Sep-2025 Forum Program Committee.
> I vividly remember we talked about how hard it would be to find good speakers
> for the topic of energy!
> Yes, energy has become ever more important topics ironically with the advent of ChatGPT in 2022
> (refer to my blog post about [critical energy issues incurred by new AI era represented by LLMs](https://sungheeyun.github.io/ai/llm/energy-challenge)),
> but for some reasons, it's not easy for find Korean-speaking speakers!
> I thought only if we relaxed that language restrictions, K-PAI would be way more impactful!
>
> But at this Sep-2025 Forum which happened 3 months after that initial meeting,
> Daniel created a Miracle. Not one, not two, not three, but FOUR amazing just right speakers
> were standing at the podium of KOTRA Alaska Auditorium
> where the historic Strategic Alliances between K-PAI and KOTRA Silicon Valley opened the Forum!
>
> However, I knew it was NOT so much of Miracle. Daniel spent tremendous efforts with amazing enthusiasm and energy
> to find those four speakers for the full 3 months!
> He showed great leadership, followership, and devotion for the honorable causes.
>
> I thought nothing else is an example of examplification. He was more than K-PAI Committee members.
> I felt sometimes shamed because I could not catch up with him in terms of his devotion and sacrifice!
> I thought
> "Ah, thanks to these unseen devotions and efforts, K-PAI has become what it is now and because of that,
> it will flourish even more!"
>
> Daniel is one of those whom I really truly from the deep down of my heart want to work with as a K-PAI Committee Member!
>
> For the aforementioned reasons,
> I once again strongly recommend Daniel for 2025 K-PAI Best Ownership Awards nomination (equally strongly as I do for MiSook ^^)!
