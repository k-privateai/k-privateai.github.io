# Korea University Business School (KUBS) Center for Digital Transformation &amp; Business (CDTB) Partnership Initiative

Following a series of AI lectures at Korea University Business School,
[Sunghee](https://sungheeyun.github.io)
as [K-PAI](/) Leader
is developing an exciting partnership opportunity with one of Korea's most prestigious business schools.

During discussions with CDTB professors after the [third AI seminar](https://sungheeyun.github.io/#cdtb-kubs-ai-seminar-oct-2025), an interesting challenge emerged -
major business management journals often prioritize theoretical completeness over practical, innovative research. This creates a gap between cutting-edge industry practices and academic publications.

# Joint Hackathon with Krafton (PUBG Developers)

[K-PAI](/) is exploring an innovative collaboration with Krafton, the renowned game developer behind PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (PUBG). This opportunity emerged from a serendipitous meeting with a talented AI leader at Krafton during [Sunghee](https://sungheeyun.github.io)'s recent visit to Seoul.

**About Krafton's AI Capabilities**
Krafton has assembled an impressive team of over 100 AI/ML PhDs and researchers. However, like many large organizations, they face departmental silo challenges that can hinder cross-functional innovation.
Their AI-based game development team is at the forefront of applying cutting-edge AI technologies to create next-generation gaming experiences
including, but not limited to, state-of-the-art LLM and genAI techniques!

**The Opportunity**
Krafton's AI team is planning a visit to Silicon Valley, and preliminary discussions have identified the possibility of co-hosting a joint hackathon with [K-PAI](/). This event would bring together:
- Krafton's game development AI expertise
- [K-PAI](/)'s privacy-preserving AI knowledge
- Silicon Valley's collaborative innovation culture

The hackathon format would foster intensive collaboration, knowledge exchange, and potentially breakthrough solutions at the intersection of gaming, AI, and privacy technology. While still in early development stages, this partnership could create a unique bridge between entertainment technology and privacy-preserving AI applications.
