[K-PAI](/)'s impact extends beyond our monthly forums through strategic partnerships and collaborative initiatives. Here are our key activities that demonstrate our commitment to bridging Silicon Valley's AI expertise with global stakeholders.

# Silicon Valley Expert Roundtable with Korean National Assembly Members @ 07-Oct-2025

On October 7, 2025, [K-PAI](/) played a pivotal role in organizing a high-level roundtable meeting titled "Silicon Valley Korean Expert Roundtable" in partnership with KOTRA Silicon Valley. This event brought together distinguished guests from South Korea, including four National Assembly members focused on AI policy, the AI-specialized consul from the Korean Consulate General, representatives from major tech companies, investors, and biotech startup executives.

As part of the [Perpetual Alliance between K-PAI and KOTRA Silicon Valley](/seminar-reflections/11#the-perpetual-alliance-between-k-pai-and-kotra-silicon-valley), [K-PAI](/) provided technical consultation by recruiting and recommending a diverse pool of Silicon Valley experts across multiple disciplines. This initiative exemplifies one of the core commitments of our strategic alliance: connecting Korean policymakers and business leaders with Silicon Valley's finest minds.

The roundtable was a resounding success, with participating experts delivering decisive insights and leading productive discussions on AI policy and technology trends.
This collaboration demonstrates **<span style="color:red;">[K-PAI](/)'s ability to mobilize our community's expertise for meaningful cross-border dialogue on critical AI and privacy issues</span>**.

# Korea University Business School (KUBS) Center for Digital Transformation &amp; Business (CDTB) Partnership Initiative

Following a series of AI lectures at Korea University Business School,
[Sunghee](https://sungheeyun.github.io)
as [K-PAI](/) Leader
is developing an exciting partnership opportunity with one of Korea's most prestigious business schools.

During discussions with CDTB professors after the [third AI seminar](https://sungheeyun.github.io/#cdtb-kubs-ai-seminar-oct-2025), an interesting challenge emerged -
major business management journals often prioritize theoretical completeness over practical, innovative research. This creates a gap between cutting-edge industry practices and academic publications.

[K-PAI](/) is proposing an online roundtable series that would connect:

- Korea University Business School professors ↔ [K-PAI Members](/membership)

**What [K-PAI](/) Brings to the Table**

- Data-driven approaches and methodologies
- Practical AI/ML implementation know-how
- Silicon Valley industry and academic insights
- Real-world case studies and applications

**What [K-PAI](/) Members Will Learn**

- Academic perspectives and research rigor
- Theoretical frameworks for AI applications
- Insights from organizational studies and sociology
- Pathways for industry-academia collaboration

This partnership represents a significant opportunity for [K-PAI](/) members to engage in meaningful external activities with tangible impact. Beyond technical discussions, this collaboration opens doors to interdisciplinary learning—from organizational management to sociological perspectives on AI deployment. The initiative also lays groundwork for potential industry-academia joint projects and expanded networking with distinguished business school faculty.

# Joint Hackathon with Krafton (PUBG Developer)

[K-PAI](/) is exploring an innovative collaboration with Krafton, the renowned game developer behind PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (PUBG). This opportunity emerged from a serendipitous meeting with a talented AI leader at Krafton during [Sunghee](https://sungheeyun.github.io)'s recent visit to Seoul.

**About Krafton's AI Capabilities**
Krafton has assembled an impressive team of over 100 AI/ML PhDs and researchers. However, like many large organizations, they face departmental silo challenges that can hinder cross-functional innovation.
Their AI-based game development team is at the forefront of applying cutting-edge AI technologies to create next-generation gaming experiences
including, but not limited to, state-of-the-art LLM and genAI techniques!

**The Opportunity**
Krafton's AI team is planning a visit to Silicon Valley, and preliminary discussions have identified the possibility of co-hosting a joint hackathon with [K-PAI](/). This event would bring together:
- Krafton's game development AI expertise
- [K-PAI](/)'s privacy-preserving AI knowledge
- Silicon Valley's collaborative innovation culture

The hackathon format would foster intensive collaboration, knowledge exchange, and potentially breakthrough solutions at the intersection of gaming, AI, and privacy technology. While still in early development stages, this partnership could create a unique bridge between entertainment technology and privacy-preserving AI applications.
