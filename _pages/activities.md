# SNU Engineering Faculty Networking Dinner & Coffee Chat @ 08-09 Jan 2026

On January 8-9, 2026, [K-PAI](/) facilitated two exceptional networking events connecting Stanford's graduate community with [Seoul National University (SNU) College of Engineering](https://k-privateai.github.io/kptm/){:target="_blank"} leadership—creating meaningful pathways for aspiring academics to explore faculty careers at one of Korea's most prestigious institutions.
These valuable connections were made possible by [Nathan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/naehyuck/){:target="_blank"},
an enthusiastic new K-PAI member who also delivered an excellent presentation at [our 13th Forum](/seminar-reflections/13#naehyuck-changs-vision---from-standard-cells-to-physical-ai){:target="_blank"}.

**January 8, 2026 - Faculty Networking Dinner**

Professor Young-Oh Kim, Dean of [Seoul National University College of Engineering](https://eng.snu.ac.kr/snuEng/main/main.do){:target="_blank"}, hosted an intimate dinner at an outstanding Chinese restaurant in Palo Alto during his Silicon Valley visit. The event was designed to provide candid, practical guidance about academic careers to Silicon Valley-based Korean scholars considering faculty positions.

The response from Stanford's graduate community was overwhelming—**so many PhD students and postdoctoral scholars wanted to participate that [K-PAI](/) regretfully had to limit attendance to 8 students** to ensure quality dialogue. The final group included 8 Stanford PhD students and postdocs across diverse engineering disciplines, plus one industry professional, creating the perfect environment for deep, meaningful conversations.

<div class="img-container">

</div>

The dinner conversation ranged widely across critical topics facing academic careers today.

- **Faculty Recruitment Strategies** - How universities should attract exceptional scholars from both academia and industry, competing with lucrative Silicon Valley opportunities while building world-class research programs
- **VISA & Immigration Challenges** - Navigating complex visa processes for international scholars—a crucial practical barrier affecting talent mobility between Silicon Valley and Korea
- **Research Areas vs. Industry Dynamics** - Balancing specialized academic research with rapidly evolving industry needs, particularly in fast-moving fields like AI, semiconductors, and biotechnology
- **Building Research Groups** - Concrete strategies for attracting talented graduate students and postdocs once becoming faculty, establishing successful research programs from scratch
- **Practical Career Concerns** - Honest, candid discussions about realistic considerations including age expectations for new faculty appointments, tenure timelines, research funding realities, and work-life balance in academia

**The dialogue was remarkably candid and practical—exactly the kind of real-world guidance that prospective faculty need but rarely receive in formal settings.** Dean Kim's openness about SNU's recruitment process, research environment, and support systems created an atmosphere where students felt comfortable asking the questions that truly matter when considering academic careers.

**January 9, 2026 - Spontaneous Coffee Chat Follow-up**

The dinner conversation was so engaging and valuable that [Sunghee](https://sungheeyun.github.io) immediately proposed and arranged a follow-up coffee chat the very next afternoon!
This spontaneous continuation demonstrated <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">K-PAI's responsiveness to community needs and commitment to maximizing value from Dean Kim's Silicon Valley visit</span>.

<div class="img-container">

</div>

The coffee chat brought Dean Kim together with another group of 18!! Stanford PhD students and postdoctoral scholars in a casual campus coffee shop setting, extending the meaningful exchange to scholars who couldn't attend the dinner. The informal atmosphere encouraged even more candid discussions about career transitions, research opportunities, and the practical realities of academic life at SNU.

**Community Impact**

These back-to-back networking events accomplished multiple strategic objectives.

- **Direct Personal Connections** - Created authentic relationships between Dean Kim and promising Silicon Valley-based Korean scholars, moving beyond transactional recruitment to genuine mentorship conversations
- **Validated Strong Demand** - Overwhelming interest from Stanford community confirmed significant appetite for Korea-US academic exchange opportunities and information about faculty careers at premier Korean institutions
- **Demonstrated [K-PAI](/) Value** - <span style="color: red;">Showcased K-PAI's ability to facilitate meaningful career development opportunities for members, connecting Silicon Valley scholars with Korean academic leadership</span>
- **Pragmatic Career Guidance** - Provided rare access to candid, practical information about academic careers that's difficult to obtain through formal channels—helping scholars make informed decisions about their futures

**The spontaneous organization of the second event perfectly exemplifies [K-PAI](/)'s agility and member-centric approach—when we saw value and demand, we acted immediately to maximize the opportunity.**

# Korea University Business School (KUBS) Center for Digital Transformation &amp; Business (CDTB) Partnership Initiative

Following a series of AI lectures at Korea University Business School,
[Sunghee](https://sungheeyun.github.io)
as [K-PAI](/) Leader
is developing an exciting partnership opportunity with one of Korea's most prestigious business schools.

During discussions with CDTB professors after the [third AI seminar](https://sungheeyun.github.io/#cdtb-kubs-ai-seminar-oct-2025), an interesting challenge emerged -
major business management journals often prioritize theoretical completeness over practical, innovative research. This creates a gap between cutting-edge industry practices and academic publications.

# Joint Hackathon with Krafton (PUBG Developers)

[K-PAI](/) is exploring an innovative collaboration with Krafton, the renowned game developer behind PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (PUBG). This opportunity emerged from a serendipitous meeting with a talented AI leader at Krafton during [Sunghee](https://sungheeyun.github.io)'s recent visit to Seoul.

**About Krafton's AI Capabilities**
Krafton has assembled an impressive team of over 100 AI/ML PhDs and researchers. However, like many large organizations, they face departmental silo challenges that can hinder cross-functional innovation.
Their AI-based game development team is at the forefront of applying cutting-edge AI technologies to create next-generation gaming experiences
including, but not limited to, state-of-the-art LLM and genAI techniques!

**The Opportunity**
Krafton's AI team is planning a visit to Silicon Valley, and preliminary discussions have identified the possibility of co-hosting a joint hackathon with [K-PAI](/). This event would bring together:
- Krafton's game development AI expertise
- [K-PAI](/)'s privacy-preserving AI knowledge
- Silicon Valley's collaborative innovation culture

The hackathon format would foster intensive collaboration, knowledge exchange, and potentially breakthrough solutions at the intersection of gaming, AI, and privacy technology. While still in early development stages, this partnership could create a unique bridge between entertainment technology and privacy-preserving AI applications.
