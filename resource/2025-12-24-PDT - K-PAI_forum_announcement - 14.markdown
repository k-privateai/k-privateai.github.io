# Invitation

K-PAI Community Members, Friends, and Innovators (and EVERYONE inhabiting or visiting Silicon Valley &#9734;^^&#9733;)!

🎉 **RING IN 2026 WITH K-PAI!** 🎉

What a year 2025 has been! From celebrating our [10th Forum milestone](/seminar-reflections/10) in August
to forging our [Historic Perpetual Partnership with KOTRA Silicon Valley](/seminar-reflections/11) in September,
to launching our [Groundbreaking Strategic Alliance with K•ASIC](/seminar-reflections/13) in November—we've
journeyed together through 13 transformative chapters of AI innovation, privacy preservation, humanistic leadership, and technological excellence.

Now it's time to **reflect, celebrate, and look forward together**!

We are **<span style="color: red;">absolutely</span>** thrilled to invite you to K-PAI's **<span style="color: red;">2026 New Year Celebration</span>**—our
14th Event and a Festive Gathering unlike any K-PAI forums you've experienced before!
This is not just another seminar; this is **<span style="color: red;">OUR celebration</span>**—a community gathering where we honor the incredible journey we've shared, recognize outstanding contributions, and collectively envision the exciting possibilities awaiting us in 2026.

- **Date**: January 14, 2026 (Wednesday)
- **Time**: 5pm - 8:30pm PST
- **Venue**: [Alaska @ KOTRA](https://maps.app.goo.gl/rodukzZGtDmz2XZM9){:target="_blank"}

Join us for an evening of **music, reflection, inspiration, recognition, fun, and meaningful connections** as we transition from an extraordinary 2025 into what promises to be an even more transformative 2026!

## Why This Celebration Matters

The past 13 months have witnessed K-PAI's evolution from a technical seminar series into a **genuine professional community** that bridges disciplines, nations, and institutions.
We've explored everything from [AI security](/seminar-reflections/09) to [humanistic leadership](/seminar-reflections/10),
from [renewable energy infrastructure](/seminar-reflections/11) to [AI-powered marketing](/seminar-reflections/12),
from [semiconductor innovation](/seminar-reflections/13)
to privacy-preserving techniques—building holistic understanding of AI's responsible development across technical, ethical, legal, and societal dimensions.

But beyond the content, we've created something even more valuable: **a community where genuine connections emerge, where diverse perspectives enrich understanding, where collaboration happens naturally, and where innovation thrives at disciplinary intersections**. This celebration honors not just our technical achievements but the human connections that make K-PAI truly special.

<span class="emph">So this evening is not about presentations—it's about US. About recognizing each other's contributions. About strengthening bonds. About laughing together. About envisioning our collective future. About celebrating what we've built and what we'll create together.</span>

## Continued Partnership Excellence

**🎉 OUR KOTRA SILICON VALLEY PARTNERSHIP CONTINUES! 🎉**

As part of our **<font color="#ee0000">Strategic Alliance</font>** between [K-PAI](/) and [KOTRA Silicon Valley](https://www.connectkotrasv.org/){:target="_blank"}, we are delighted to host this celebration at the prestigious [Alaska venue](https://maps.app.goo.gl/rodukzZGtDmz2XZM9){:target="_blank"}—a space that has become synonymous with K-PAI's warmth, hospitality, and community spirit!

The KOTRA partnership continues enabling the world-class experiences you've come to expect from K-PAI events: exceptional venues, premium hospitality, and **seamless logistics** that allow us to focus on what matters most—content, connections, and community.
We extend our heartfelt gratitude to [KOTRA Silicon Valley](https://www.connectkotrasv.org){:target="_blank"} for their unwavering support in making K-PAI's continued success possible, and for providing the perfect setting for this special celebration.

## Beyond Forums - A Community Coming Alive!

While our 13 forums provided the intellectual foundation, **the real magic of 2025 happened in the spaces between**—in the spontaneous group meetings, the strategic partnerships, the personal transformations, and the exponential community growth that turned [K-PAI](/) from an event series into a living, breathing ecosystem!

### Strategic Activities &amp; Partnerships

**[K-PAI Activities](/activities)** demonstrates our expanding influence beyond monthly forums.

[**🏛️ Silicon Valley Expert Roundtable with Korean National Assembly Members (October 7, 2025)**](/activities/#silicon-valley-expert-roundtable-with-korean-national-assembly-members--07-oct-2025)
[K-PAI](/) mobilized our community's expertise for high-level policy dialogue! As part of our strategic alliance with KOTRA Silicon Valley, we recruited and coordinated Silicon Valley experts across multiple disciplines to engage with four National Assembly members focused on AI policy, the AI-specialized consul, and representatives from major tech companies. <span class="emph">This exemplifies [K-PAI](/)'s unique ability to bridge Silicon Valley technical excellence with Korean policymaking—creating tangible impact beyond academic discourse.</span>

[**🎓 Korea University Business School (KUBS) Partnership Initiative (Under Development)**](/activities/#korea-university-business-school-kubs-center-for-digital-transformation--business-cdtb-partnership-initiative)
Following [Sunghee](https://sungheeyun.github.io)'s AI seminar series at KUBS, we're developing an innovative online roundtable series connecting KUBS professors with [K-PAI](/) members. The opportunity: bridging academic rigor with Silicon Valley's practical AI implementation know-how. KUBS brings theoretical frameworks and organizational studies; [K-PAI](/) brings data-driven methodologies and real-world applications. This interdisciplinary collaboration opens doors for members to engage meaningfully in industry-academia joint projects!

[**🎮 Joint Hackathon with Krafton (PUBG Developers) (Under Development)**](/activities/#joint-hackathon-with-krafton-pubg-developers)
An exciting collaboration emerging from serendipitous connections! Krafton's AI/ML PhD team is planning a Silicon Valley visit, and preliminary discussions point toward a co-hosted hackathon. Imagine: Krafton's game development AI expertise + [K-PAI](/)'s AI knowledge + Silicon Valley's collaborative innovation culture = breakthrough solutions at the intersection of gaming, AI, and privacy technology!

### Organic Group Meetings - Community Self-Organization

[**K-PAI Groups**](/groups) showcases something truly special—**members spontaneously organizing their own gatherings**! This organic growth signals genuine community vitality:

- **November 4th**: The **FIRST** K-PAI Bio/Medical/Data group meeting in Mountain View (Chanik, Insuk, Mitch, Minha, Sunghee)
- **November 10th**: K-PAI meets KABANC in Palo Alto (Daniel, Hayden, Jeff, Sunghee)
- **November 14th**: Interdisciplinary gathering in Berkeley—lawyers, judges, engineers, scientists, entrepreneurs!
- **November 15th**: K-PAI + Institute for Information Communication Technology Planning and Evaluation (IITP) in Morgan Hill
- **November 27th**: Early morning breakfast in Seoul (June Hee, Chanik, Sunghee)
- **December 5th**: Flash meetup in Santa Clara (Jae Chul, Goonho, Wonpyo, Sunghee)

<font color="red">These weren't organized by [K-PAI](/) leadership—members themselves initiated these connections! This is how genuine professional communities evolve: from scheduled forums to spontaneous collaboration emerging naturally from shared interests and mutual respect.</font>

### Personal Transformations: Individual Impact Stories

[**To Me, K-PAI is...**](/kptm/) captures profound personal journeys enabled by our community:

<!--
**Hyein Kim** (Visiting Student): *"K-PAI truly made my semester in San Francisco more meaningful, connected, and exciting."* One semester, transformative connections—from Plug and Play invitations to partnership opportunities for the Korea-America Student Conference (KASC) focusing on semiconductors and AI collaboration.

**MiSook Chung** (Community Visionary): *"K-PAI embodies a community where curiosity meets conscience, and where conversations about AI are ultimately conversations about humanity."* Her reflection on Margaret Mead's healed femur story reminds us: an advanced AI society isn't defined by how intelligent our machines become, but by how responsibly and compassionately we use technology to serve humanity.

**Gordon Park** (Bio Researcher): *"바이오는 CS 분야의 도움을 통해 이해해야 하는 시대가 이미 왔다고 생각합니다."* (Bio requires CS understanding—that era has arrived.) K-PAI provides exactly this intersection, helping bio researchers navigate the data-driven AI landscape while reducing bias and improving accuracy through interdisciplinary collaboration.

**Ik-Jung (Joe) Kim** (Startup Founder): Perhaps the most dramatic transformation—when registering for K-PAI, Joe spontaneously created his company name and wrote "CEO" in the title field. *That moment became the start of his entrepreneurial journey!* Through K-PAI connections, he gained the network and inspiration to grow his startup step by step.
-->

<span class="emph">These aren't just networking success stories—they're life trajectory changes enabled by a community that genuinely cares about human flourishing alongside technical excellence.</span>

### Explosive Committee Growth: 4 → 20! 🚀

Perhaps the most tangible evidence of [K-PAI](/)'s evolution: **[our committee](/committee) has quintupled from 4 original organizers to 20 dedicated members** ★^^★

<!--
**Organizing Committee** (4 members):
Jung Hee Cheon, Chanik Park, Sunghee Yun, Daejun Park

**Operating Committee** (7 members):
Jun Yeong Jang, Hyun Jung Noh, Christine Cho, Alex Moon, Jaehyeok Bae, Sehui Jeong, Hagoon Jang

**Program Committee** (9 members):
Siyeon Rhee, MiSook Chung, Daniel Hur, Austin Jin, Haeyun Kim, Seyoung Choi, Sue Kim, Kain Sunwoo, Joohyeun Yi

This 5x growth demonstrates:
- **Scalable organizational structure** enabling sustainable operations
- **Distributed leadership** preventing single-point-of-failure dependencies
- **Diverse skill sets** spanning operations, programming, and strategic planning
- **Community investment** where members volunteer substantial time because they believe in K-PAI's mission
- **Professional maturity** transitioning from informal gatherings to institutionalized excellence
-->

<font color="red">Twenty people dedicating their time and expertise to make [K-PAI](/) exceptional—that's not just organizational growth, that's a movement!</font>

### The Compound Effect

When you combine:
- 13 transformative forums covering AI's complete landscape
- Strategic partnerships with KOTRA SV, K•ASIC, KUBS, Krafton
- High-level policy engagement (National Assembly roundtables)
- Organic group meetings self-organizing across specializations
- Individual member transformations (students → professionals, professionals → entrepreneurs)
- Committee scaling 5x (4 → 20 dedicated volunteers)
- **[Membership structure](/membership)** formalizing community tiers and benefits

<!--
What emerges is **exponentially more valuable than the sum of parts**. K-PAI has become a platform where:
- **Technical innovation** meets **humanistic values**
- **Korean heritage** bridges **Silicon Valley culture**
- **Individual growth** compounds into **collective impact**
- **Formal structure** enables **organic spontaneity**
- **Professional networking** deepens into **genuine friendship**

This is what we're celebrating on January 14th—not just 13 forums, but the **complete ecosystem** those forums enabled. An ecosystem that now has its own momentum, generating value through connections and collaborations we never could have predicted or orchestrated centrally.
-->

<span class="emph">So when you attend the New Year Party, you're not just celebrating what [K-PAI](/) did in 2025—you're celebrating what [K-PAI](/) has BECOME, and the infinite possibilities that emergence creates for 2026 and beyond!</span>

## Holistic Synthesis - The AI Landscape through [K-PAI](/)'s Lens (6:30pm ~ 6:45pm)

**13 Forums, One Coherent Vision - Connecting the Dots**

What insights emerge when we synthesize 13 forums spanning security, ethics, law, energy, marketing, semiconductors, and more? How do these apparently diverse topics actually interconnect into a coherent understanding of responsible AI development?

- **Human dimensions** - Agency, dignity, privacy, and human flourishing as through-lines across all forums

<span class="emph">This synthesis demonstrates that [K-PAI](/)'s true value lies not in individual forums but in cumulative understanding—building systems-level comprehension where each new perspective enriches appreciation of all others.</span>

<span style="color: red;">Expect frameworks, mental models, and conceptual architectures that help organize and integrate the rich knowledge we've collectively absorbed throughout 2025.</span>

## Community Voice - What We Want from [K-PAI](/)! (6:45pm ~ 7pm)

**What We Want from [K-PAI](/) - Hopes, Dreams, and Aspirations**

What does the [K-PAI](/) community want? What should we do more of? What could we improve? What dreams do members harbor for what [K-PAI](/) might become?

[Sue Kim](https://www.linkedin.com/in/suekimpr/){:taget="_blank"} &amp; [MiSook](https://www.linkedin.com/in/misook-chung/){:taget="_blank"}
will channel the community's collective voice—speaking not as individuals but as representative of the diverse hopes, expectations, and aspirations our members hold for [K-PAI](/)'s future. This segment provides structured opportunity for community feedback, ensuring [K-PAI](/)'s leadership remains responsive to member needs and desires.

<span class="emph">Your voice matters! This presentation will be informed by pre-event community input, but the Q&A provides space for additional perspectives. Let's collectively shape what K-PAI becomes.</span>
